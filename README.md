# React HTML

#### this boilerplate has some limitations because you can't have components, you have to do everything in 1 file

But you can have components in your css. Note that there is a folder called `imports`. inside of that folder we have an `imports.css`, that file imports everything of css.

There is also a folder in our css which is called `components`. Inside that folder we can have our styles

it will look like this

```js
return (
    <div className="main">
    <div className="main__header">
        <h1>React App</h1>
    </div>
);

ReactDOM.render(<Main />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

we can have a seperate file for the `main__header`

# thats how this works
